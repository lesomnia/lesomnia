lesomnia - Less insomnia
========================
`lesomnia` is an ugly hack I made the last minutes before going to bed, deciding I want to wake up the next day with music - played by my lovely laptop which is rests next to me.

Usage (non of the arguments are optional):
```
./lesomnia 110% 10:30 https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=Fow7iUaKrq4
./lesomnia 100% 04:30 ./path-to-audio.ogg ./path-to-other-track.ogg
```
